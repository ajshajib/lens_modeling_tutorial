# Lens modeler in six weeks

This repository contains tutorials to self-learn 
lens modeling with [`lenstronomy`](https://github.com/lenstronomy/lenstronomy) through assignments and work notebooks. 
The assignments are designed to be completed 
in six weeks. This tutorial is geared for 2nd/3rd year undergraduate students and above 
without much prior knowledge in astronomy, however, `Python` is a prerequisite. 

These tutorials are slightly modified from the tutorials used for a research workshop 
carried out for undergraduate students as part of the [Astro Bridge](https://www.astrobridge.org/projects/bdlensing) program.

The reference textbook is [Introduction to Gravitational Lensing](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-73582-1) by Massimo Meneghetti.
