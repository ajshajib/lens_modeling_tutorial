1. Try to understand these terms as much as possible, if not already: probability 
density, standard deviation, variance, Poisson distribution, binomial distribution, Gaussian distribution, and Poisson noise (or shot noise).

   1. You can use Google search to find reading materials on these topics (being 
   proficient with Google search to find necessary resources is one skill this project aims to develop).

   2. During next meeting, we will discuss the above terms and perform activities 
   with the main goal of understanding Poisson noise. Being familiar with these terms as much as possible beforehand will help you gain the most out of the discussion. This follows a modern learning strategy called “the flipped classroom.”

2. (Optional) Write a Python code that counts how many times the head has come up 
after N = 200 coin tosses, with each toss having a 40% probability for the head and a 60% probability for the tail. The total number of heads is a random number, so it should not give the same answer each time your code is run.
3. (Optional) If you have spare time, read Chapter 1 from the book “Introduction to 
   Gravitational Lensing” by Menghetti.
