1. Check out the notebook "*Fitting a lens model by hand.ipynb*" and try to develop an 
   intuition for how different parameters involved in a lensing system can change the look of the system. Create a perfectly round Einstein ring by appropriately choosing the slider values in the section “Simulating a lens system.” In the section “Demonstration of lens modeling by tuning parameters by hand”, try to achieve a reduced $\chi^2$ as close to 1 as possible. If you want to look at the right answers, they’re given here. 
2. Complete assignment 2 from last week, if not already.
3. Work with the notebook "*Intro to lens modeling with lenstornomy.ipynb*". Fit the 
   lensing system given to you (that matches your team number and order) last week 
   in this folder. The fitting is done well when you get a reduced $\chi^2$ very close 
   to 1.
4. Understand everything that is being done in the notebook. (It’s fine to not fully 
   understand `kwargs_likelihood` and `kwargs_numerics` at this point.)
5. Run an MCMC after the PSO. Ensure that the MCMC chain has converged. Obtain the 
   best-fit values and uncertainties for $\theta_{\rm E}$ and $\gamma$.
